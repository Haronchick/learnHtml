            <figcaption>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact
                that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
                here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
                model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
                in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
